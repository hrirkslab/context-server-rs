# SOLID Principles Implementation

This document explains how SOLID principles have been applied to improve the codebase architecture.

## Summary of Changes

The codebase has been refactored from a monolithic `ContextMcpServer` struct to a layered architecture following SOLID principles:

### Before (Monolithic)
```
ContextMcpServer
└── Direct database operations
└── Mixed business logic
└── Hard-coded dependencies
└── Difficult to test/extend
```

### After (SOLID Architecture)
```
ContextMcpServer (Presentation Layer)
└── AppContainer (Dependency Injection)
    ├── Services (Business Logic)
    │   ├── ProjectService
    │   ├── FlutterService
    │   ├── ContextQueryService
    │   └── ArchitectureValidationService
    └── Repositories (Data Access)
        ├── SqliteProjectRepository
        ├── SqliteFlutterRepository
        └── SqliteBusinessRuleRepository
```

## SOLID Principles Applied

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Before**: `ContextMcpServer` handled everything - database operations, business logic, validation, and API responses.

**After**: Each class has one reason to change:
- `ProjectService`: Only handles project-related business logic
- `FlutterService`: Only handles Flutter component operations
- `ArchitectureValidationService`: Only handles architecture validation
- `SqliteProjectRepository`: Only handles project data persistence

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Before**: Adding new features required modifying the main server class.

**After**: The system is open for extension but closed for modification:
- New validation rules can be added to `ArchitectureValidationService` without changing existing code
- New repository implementations can be swapped in via dependency injection
- New services can be added to the container without modifying existing services

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Before**: No abstraction layers, direct concrete dependencies.

**After**: Interfaces allow substitutability:
- Any `ProjectRepository` implementation can replace `SqliteProjectRepository`
- Different database backends (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) could be swapped in
- Mock implementations can be used for testing

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Before**: Large, monolithic interface in the main server.

**After**: Small, focused interfaces:
- `ProjectRepository` only contains project-related methods
- `FlutterRepository` only contains Flutter component methods
- `ArchitectureValidationService` only contains validation methods

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Before**: High-level modules depended on low-level modules (direct database access).

**After**: Both depend on abstractions:
- Services depend on repository interfaces, not concrete implementations
- `AppContainer` handles dependency injection
- Database implementation details are hidden behind repository interfaces

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Testability
- Services can be unit tested with mock repositories
- Each component can be tested in isolation
- Clear separation of concerns makes testing easier

### 2. Maintainability
- Changes to database schema only affect repository layer
- Business logic changes only affect service layer
- Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility

### 3. Extensibility
- New features can be added without modifying existing code
- New validation rules can be plugged in easily
- Different data sources can be supported by implementing repository interfaces

### 4. Dependency Management
- Clear dependency flow: Presentation → Services → Repositories
- No circular dependencies
- Dependencies injected rather than hard-coded

## Architecture Layers

### Presentation Layer
- `ContextMcpServer`: Handles MCP protocol, delegates to services
- `ContextMcpServerSolid`: New SOLID-compliant implementation

### Application/Service Layer
- `ProjectService`: Project business logic
- `FlutterService`: Flutter component operations
- `ContextQueryService`: Context querying logic
- `ArchitectureValidationService`: Architecture rule validation

### Domain Layer
- Repository interfaces: `ProjectRepository`, `FlutterRepository`, etc.
- Domain models: `Project`, `FlutterComponent`, `BusinessRule`

### Infrastructure Layer
- `SqliteProjectRepository`: SQLite implementation of project persistence
- `SqliteFlutterRepository`: SQLite implementation of Flutter component persistence
- `AppContainer`: Dependency injection container

## Usage

The refactored server can be used as a drop-in replacement:

```rust
// Old way (monolithic)
let server = ContextMcpServer::new(db_path)?;

// New way (SOLID)
let server = ContextMcpServerSolid::new(db_path)?;
```

The new architecture maintains the same external API while providing much better internal structure.

## Future Extensions

With this SOLID foundation, the following extensions become much easier:

1. **New Database Backends**: Implement `PostgresProjectRepository`
2. **New Validation Rules**: Add rules to `ArchitectureValidationService`
3. **Caching Layer**: Add caching repositories that wrap existing ones
4. **Audit Logging**: Add audit services that log all operations
5. **Testing**: Create mock implementations for all interfaces
6. **Metrics**: Add monitoring services at the service layer

The SOLID principles ensure that these extensions can be added without modifying existing, working code.
