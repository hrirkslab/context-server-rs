# Task 3.3 Implementation Summary: Conflict Resolution Engine

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive conflict resolution engine for the professional context engine, fulfilling all requirements specified in task 3.3. The implementation includes conflict detection algorithms, multiple merge strategies, UI components and workflows, and comprehensive testing.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Conflict Resolution Engine (`src/services/conflict_resolution_engine.rs`)

**Core Features:**
- **Conflict Detection Algorithms**: Implemented multiple conflict detection methods:
  - Version-based conflict detection (incoming change has older version than existing entity)
  - Content-based conflict detection (concurrent changes within configurable time threshold)
  - Semantic conflict detection (placeholder for business rule violations)
  - Dependency conflict detection (placeholder for relationship violations)

- **Merge Strategies**: Implemented all required conflict resolution strategies:
  - **Last Writer Wins**: Accepts the most recent change and discards others
  - **Auto Merge**: Automatically merges non-conflicting changes using field-level merging
  - **Manual Resolution**: Allows human reviewers to manually resolve conflicts
  - **Reject**: Rejects all conflicting changes and keeps the original

- **Conflict Management**: 
  - Active conflict tracking with unique conflict IDs
  - Conflict metadata including detection time, resolution strategy, and resolver information
  - Cleanup mechanisms for resolved conflicts
  - Project-level conflict querying and management

**Key Classes:**
- `ConflictResolutionEngine`: Main engine for detecting and resolving conflicts
- `ConflictInfo`: Detailed information about detected conflicts
- `ConflictingChange`: Individual changes that are in conflict
- `ConflictResolutionResult`: Results of conflict resolution operations

### 2. Conflict Resolution UI (`src/services/conflict_resolution_ui.rs`)

**UI Workflow Components:**
- **Session Management**: Complete session lifecycle management for conflict resolution
- **Multi-Step Workflow**: Structured workflow with distinct steps:
  - Conflict Presentation: Shows conflicting changes and their differences
  - Strategy Selection: Allows users to choose resolution strategy
  - Manual Resolution: Provides tools for manual conflict resolution
  - Preview Confirmation: Shows preview of resolved entity before applying
  - Completion: Finalizes the resolution

- **UI Components**: Comprehensive set of UI components:
  - `ConflictOverview`: Displays conflict summary and metadata
  - `DiffViewer`: Shows differences between conflicting changes
  - `StrategySelector`: Interface for choosing resolution strategy
  - `EntityEditor`: Manual editing interface for complex resolutions
  - `FieldMerger`: Field-by-field conflict resolution interface
  - `PreviewPanel`: Preview of final resolved entity

- **Validation and Error Handling**: 
  - Real-time validation of user inputs
  - Context-aware error messages and suggestions
  - Progress tracking with estimated completion times

**Key Classes:**
- `ConflictResolutionUI`: Main UI service for managing resolution sessions
- `ConflictResolutionSession`: Individual resolution session with state management
- `UIComponent`: Configurable UI components for different resolution steps
- `ValidationError`: Structured validation errors with severity levels

### 3. Integration with Sync Engine

**Enhanced Sync Engine Integration:**
- Extended `SyncEngine` to include conflict resolution capabilities
- Added methods for conflict detection, resolution, and management
- Integrated with existing real-time synchronization infrastructure
- Backward compatibility with existing sync operations

**New Sync Engine Methods:**
- `detect_and_handle_conflict()`: Detects conflicts for incoming changes
- `resolve_conflict()`: Resolves conflicts using specified strategies
- `resolve_conflict_manually()`: Handles manual resolution requests
- `get_conflict_info()`: Retrieves conflict information
- `get_active_conflicts()` / `get_resolved_conflicts()`: Conflict querying

### 4. Data Models and Types

**Enhanced WebSocket Types:**
- Added `PartialEq` to `ConflictStrategy` for testing and comparison
- Extended conflict resolution metadata in change events
- Improved type safety and serialization support

**Conflict-Specific Models:**
- `ConflictType`: Enumeration of different conflict types
- `ConflictResolutionConfig`: Configuration for conflict resolution behavior
- `ManualResolutionRequest`: Structured request for manual conflict resolution
- `ConflictResolutionResult`: Detailed results of resolution operations
