# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the existing MCP Context Server into a professional-grade context engine that AI agents will love to use. The current system provides basic context storage and retrieval but lacks the sophisticated features needed for production AI development workflows. This enhancement will transform it into a comprehensive, intelligent context management system that anticipates AI agent needs and provides rich, actionable context.

**User Story:** As a development team, I want context changes to be synchronized in real-time across all AI agents and team members, so that everyone has access to the latest project information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN context is modified by any agent or user THEN all connected clients SHALL receive real-time updates
2. WHEN multiple agents modify context simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully with merge strategies
3. WHEN team members join a project THEN they SHALL automatically receive the complete context state
4. WHEN working offline THEN changes SHALL be queued and synchronized when connection is restored
5. IF context sync fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Context Analytics and Usage Intelligence

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to understand how context is being used and which information is most valuable, so that I can optimize our development process and context quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI agents query context THEN the system SHALL track usage patterns and frequency
2. WHEN context proves useful for code generation THEN the system SHALL record success metrics
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide insights on context effectiveness and gaps
4. WHEN context is unused for extended periods THEN the system SHALL suggest archival or removal
5. IF context quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for improvement

### Requirement 5: Advanced Search and Semantic Understanding

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to find relevant context using natural language queries and semantic search, so that I can quickly locate the information I need without knowing exact keywords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing a search query THEN the system SHALL support natural language and semantic search
2. WHEN searching for context THEN results SHALL be ranked by relevance and recency
3. WHEN context contains code or technical terms THEN the system SHALL understand programming concepts and relationships
4. WHEN searching across projects THEN the system SHALL provide cross-project insights and patterns
5. IF search results are insufficient THEN the system SHALL suggest query refinements or alternative searches

### Requirement 6: Context Validation and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a development team, I want the context server to automatically validate context quality and consistency, so that we maintain high-quality, reliable project information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN context is added or modified THEN the system SHALL validate it against defined quality standards
2. WHEN business rules conflict THEN the system SHALL detect and report inconsistencies
3. WHEN architectural decisions contradict THEN the system SHALL flag potential issues
4. WHEN context becomes outdated THEN the system SHALL automatically mark it for review
5. IF context quality degrades THEN the system SHALL provide specific improvement suggestions

### Requirement 7: Extensible Plugin Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extend the context server with custom plugins and integrations, so that I can adapt it to specific project needs and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing custom functionality THEN the system SHALL provide a well-defined plugin API
2. WHEN integrating with external tools THEN plugins SHALL have access to context data and events
3. WHEN plugins are installed THEN they SHALL be automatically discovered and loaded
4. WHEN plugins fail THEN the core system SHALL remain stable and functional
5. IF plugin conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide resolution mechanisms

### Requirement 8: Advanced Code Analysis Integration

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want the context server to automatically analyze code changes and update context accordingly, so that project information stays synchronized with the actual codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code files change THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze changes and update relevant context
2. WHEN new components are added THEN the system SHALL automatically create context entries with proper categorization
3. WHEN dependencies change THEN the system SHALL update architectural context and validate compliance
4. WHEN code patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest context updates or new conventions
5. IF code analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms and error reporting

### Requirement 9: Multi-Project Context Management

**User Story:** As an organization, I want to manage context across multiple projects and share common patterns, so that we can leverage knowledge across our entire development portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with multiple projects THEN the system SHALL provide unified context management
2. WHEN patterns emerge across projects THEN the system SHALL suggest creating shared context templates
3. WHEN onboarding new projects THEN the system SHALL recommend relevant context from similar projects
4. WHEN context is valuable across projects THEN the system SHALL support context sharing and inheritance
5. IF project contexts conflict THEN the system SHALL provide isolation and conflict resolution

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the context server to handle large amounts of context data efficiently, so that it remains responsive even with extensive project information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling large context datasets THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-second response times
2. WHEN multiple agents query simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently
3. WHEN context data grows THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize storage and indexing
4. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade performance while maintaining functionality
5. IF performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and diagnostic tools

### Requirement 11: Project Specification and Task Management Integration
